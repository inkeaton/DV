We present a higher-order approach to the extraction of isosurfaces from unstructured meshes. Existing methods use linear interpolation along each mesh edge to find isosurface intersections. In contrast, our method determines intersections by performing barycentric interpolation over diamonds formed by the tetrahedra incident to each edge. Our method produces smoother, more accurate isosurfaces. Additionally, interpolating over diamonds, rather than linearly interpolating edge endpoints. enables us to identify up to two isosurface intersections per edge. This paper details how our new technique extracts isopoints, and presents a simple connection strategy for forming a triangle mesh isosurface. . isosurface extraction, interpolation, unstructured mesh', 'Real-time refinement and simplification of adaptive triangular meshes . In this paper we present a generic method for incremental mesh adaptation based on hierarchy of semi-regular meshes. Our method supports any refinement rule mapping vertices onto vertices such as 1-to-4 split or /spl radic/3-subdivision. Resulting adaptive mesh has subdivision connectivity and hence good aspect ratio of triangles. Hierarchic representation of the mesh allows incremental local refinement and simplification operations exploiting frame-to-frame coherence. We also present an out-of-core storage layout scheme designed for semi-regular meshes of arbitrary subdivision connectivity. It provides high cache coherency in the data retrieval and relies on the interleaved storage of resolution levels and maintaining good geometrical proximity within each level. The efficiency of the proposed method is demonstrated with applications in physically-based cloth simulation, real-time terrain visualization and procedural modeling. . adaptive meshes, refinement and simplification, subdivision, multiresoluton, level of detail, frame-to-frame coherence, out-of-core visualization', 'Hardware-based ray casting for tetrahedral meshes . We present the first implementation of a volume ray casting algorithm for tetrahedral meshes running on off-the-shelf programmable graphics hardware. Our implementation avoids the memory transfer bottleneck of the graphics bus since the complete mesh data is stored in the local memory of the graphics adapter and all computations, in particular ray traversal and ray integration, are performed by the graphics processing unit. Analogously to other ray casting algorithms, our algorithm does not require an expensive cell sorting. Provided that the graphics adapter offers enough texture memory, our implementation performs comparable to the fastest published volume rendering algorithms for unstructured meshes. Our approach works with cyclic and/or non-convex meshes and supports early ray termination. Accurate ray integration is guaranteed by applying pre-integrated volume rendering. In order to achieve almost interactive modifications of transfer functions, we propose a new method for computing three-dimensional pre-integration tables. . ray casting, pixel shading, programmable graphics hardware, cell projection, tetrahedral meshes, unstructured meshes, volume visualization, pre-integrated volume rendering']",tetrahedral meshes • surface reconstruction • direct volume rendering • marching cubes,Isosurfaces & Volume Rendering,Isosurface Extraction & Direct Volume Rendering (Meshes)

Typical scientific data is represented on a grid with appropriate interpolation or approximation schemes,defined on a continuous domain. The visualization of such data in parallel coordinates may reveal patterns latently contained in the data and thus can improve the understanding of multidimensional relations. In this paper, we adopt the concept of continuous scatterplots for the visualization of spatially continuous input data to derive a density model for parallel coordinates. Based on the point-line duality between scatterplots and parallel coordinates, we propose a mathematical model that maps density from a continuous scatterplot to parallel coordinates and present different algorithms for both numerical and analytical computation of the resulting density field. In addition, we show how the 2-D model can be used to successively construct continuous parallel coordinates with an arbitrary number of dimensions. Since continuous parallel coordinates interpolate data values within grid cells, a scalable and dense visualization is achieved, which will be demonstrated for typical multi-variate scientific data. .

In our framework, the user can visualize not only the BCSs but also their construction process.

In this paper, we present a novel parallel coordinates design integrated with points (scattering points in parallel coordinates, SPPC), by taking advantage of both parallel coordinates and scatterplots. Different from most multiple views visualization frameworks involving parallel coordinates where each visualization type occupies an individual window, we convert two selected neighboring coordinate axes into a scatterplot directly. Multidimensional scaling is adopted to allow converting multiple axes into a single subplot. The transition between two visual types is designed in a seamless way. In our work, a series of interaction tools has been developed. Uniform brushing functionality is implemented to allow the user to perform data selection on both points and parallel coordinate polylines without explicitly switching tools. A GPU accelerated dimensional incremental multidimensional scaling (DIMDS) has been developed to significantly improve the system performance.

We conduct a user study to quantify and compare user performance for a value comparison task using four bar chart designs, where the bars show the mean values of data loaded progressively and updated every second (progressive bar charts). Progressive visualization divides different stages of the visualization pipeline—data loading, processing, and visualization—into iterative animated steps to limit the latency when loading large amounts of data. An animated visualization appearing quickly, unfolding, and getting more accurate with time, enables users to make early decisions. However, intermediate mean estimates are computed only on partial data and may not have time to converge to the true means, potentially misleading users and resulting in incorrect decisions. To address this issue, we propose two new designs visualizing the history of values in progressive bar charts, in addition to the use of confidence intervals. We comparatively study four progressive bar chart designs: with/without confidence intervals, and using near-history representation with/without confidence intervals, on three realistic data distributions. We evaluate user performance based on the percentage of correct answers (accuracy), response time, and user confidence. Our results show that, overall, users can make early and accurate decisions with 92% accuracy using only 18% of the data, regardless of the design. We find that our proposed bar chart design with only near-history is comparable to bar charts with only confidence intervals in performance, and the qualitative feedback we received indicates a preference for designs with history. .

In a classic graphical perception paper, Cleveland &amp;amp; McGill studied how different bar chart designs impact the accuracy with which viewers can complete simple perceptual tasks. They found that people perform substantially worse on stacked bar charts than on aligned bar charts, and that comparisons between adjacent bars are more accurate than between widely separated bars. However, the study did not explore why these differences occur. In this paper, we describe a series of follow-up experiments to further explore and explain their results. While our results generally confirm Cleveland &amp;amp; McGill's ranking of various bar chart configurations, we provide additional insight into the bar chart reading task and the sources of participants' errors. We use our results to propose new hypotheses on the perception of bar charts. . Graphical perception, bar charts"", 'Truth or Square: Aspect Ratio Biases Recall of Position Encodings . Bar charts are among the most frequently used visualizations, in part because their position encoding leads them to convey data values precisely. Yet reproductions of single bars or groups of bars within a graph can be biased. Curiously, some previous work found that this bias resulted in an overestimation of reproduced data values, while other work found an underestimation. Across three empirical studies, we offer an explanation for these conflicting findings: this discrepancy is a consequence of the differing aspect ratios of the tested bar marks. Viewers are biased to remember a bar mark as being more similar to a prototypical square, leading to an overestimation of bars with a wide aspect ratio, and an underestimation of bars with a tall aspect ratio. Experiments 1 and 2 showed that the aspect ratio of the bar marks indeed influenced the direction of this bias. Experiment 3 confirmed that this pattern of misestimation bias was present for reproductions from memory, suggesting that this bias may arise when comparing values across sequential displays or views. We describe additional visualization designs that might be prone to this bias beyond bar charts (e.g., Mekko charts and treemaps), and speculate that other visual channels might hold similar biases toward prototypical values. .

Natural language interfaces (NLls) have shown great promise for visual data analysis, allowing people to flexibly specify and interact with visualizations. However, developing visualization NLIs remains a challenging task, requiring low-level implementation of natural language processing (NLP) techniques as well as knowledge of visual analytic tasks and visualization design. We present NL4DV, a toolkit for natural language-driven data visualization. NL4DV is a Python package that takes as input a tabular dataset and a natural language query about that dataset. In response, the toolkit returns an analytic specification modeled as a JSON object containing data attributes, analytic tasks, and a list of Vega-Lite specifications relevant to the input query. In doing so, NL4DV aids visualization developers who may not have a background in NLP, enabling them to create new visualization NLIs or incorporate natural language input within their existing systems. We demonstrate NL4DV's usage and capabilities through four examples: 1) rendering visualizations using natural language in a Jupyter notebook, 2) developing a NLI to specify and edit Vega-Lite charts, 3) recreating data ambiguity widgets from the DataTone system, and 4) incorporating speech input to create a multimodal visualization system. . Natural Language Interfaces,Visualization Toolkits"", ""Towards Natural Language-Based Visualization Authoring . A key challenge to visualization authoring is the process of getting familiar with the complex user interfaces of authoring tools. Natural Language Interface (NLI) presents promising benefits due to its learnability and usability. However, supporting NLIs for authoring tools requires expertise in natural language processing, while existing NLIs are mostly designed for visual analytic workflow. In this paper, we propose an authoring-oriented NLI pipeline by introducing a structured representation of users' visualization editing intents, called editing actions, based on a formative study and an extensive survey on visualization construction tools. The editing actions are executable, and thus decouple natural language interpretation and visualization applications as an intermediate layer. We implement a deep learning-based NL interpreter to translate NL utterances into editing actions. The interpreter is reusable and extensible across authoring tools. The authoring tools only need to map the editing actions into tool-specific operations. To illustrate the usages of the NL interpreter, we implement an Excel chart editor and a proof-of-concept authoring tool, VisTalk. We conduct a user study with VisTalk to understand the usage patterns of NL-based authoring systems. Finally, we discuss observations on how users author charts with natural language, as well as implications for future research. .

Sensemaking is described as the process of comprehension, finding meaning and gaining insight from information, producing new knowledge and informing further action. Understanding the sensemaking process allows building effective visual analytics tools to make sense of large and complex datasets. Currently, it is often a manual and time-consuming undertaking to comprehend this: researchers collect observation data, transcribe screen capture videos and think-aloud recordings, identify recurring patterns, and eventually abstract the sensemaking process into a general model. In this paper, we propose a general approach to facilitate such a qualitative analysis process, and introduce a prototype, SensePath, to demonstrate the application of this approach with a focus on browser-based online sensemaking. The approach is based on a study of a number of qualitative research sessions including observations of users performing sensemaking tasks and post hoc analyses to uncover their sensemaking processes. Based on the study results and a follow-up participatory design session with HCI researchers, we decided to focus on the transcription and coding stages of thematic analysis. SensePath automatically captures user's sensemaking actions, i.e., analytic provenance, and provides multi-linked views to support their further analysis. A number of other requirements elicited from the design session are also implemented in SensePath, such as easy integration with existing qualitative analysis workflow and non-intrusive for participants. The tool was used by an experienced HCI researcher to analyze two sensemaking sessions. The researcher found the tool intuitive and considerably reduced analysis time, allowing better understanding of the sensemaking process. .

The topological analysis of unsteady vector fields remains to this day one of the largest challenges in flow visualization. We build up on recent work on vortex extraction to define a time-dependent vector field topology for 2D and 3D flows. In our work, we split the vector field into two components: a vector field in which the flow becomes steady, and the remaining ambient flow that describes the motion of topological elements (such as sinks, sources and saddles) and feature curves (vortex corelines and bifurcation lines). To this end, we expand on recent local optimization approaches by modeling spatially-varying deformations through displacement transformations from continuum mechanics. We compare and discuss the relationships with existing local and integration-based topology extraction methods, showing for instance that separatrices seeded from saddles in the optimal frame align with the integration-based streakline vector field topology. In contrast to the streakline-based approach, our method gives a complete picture of the topology for every time slice, including the steps near the temporal domain boundaries. With our work it now becomes possible to extract topological information even when only few time slices are available. We demonstrate the method in several analytical and numerically-simulated flows and discuss practical aspects, limitations and opportunities for future work. .

In nature and in flow experiments particles form patterns of swirling motion in certain locations. Existing approaches identify these structures by considering the behavior of stream lines. However, in unsteady flows particle motion is described by path lines which generally gives different swirling patterns than stream lines. We introduce a novel mathematical characterization of swirling motion cores in unsteady flows by generalizing the approach of Sujudi/Haimes to path lines. The cores of swirling particle motion are lines sweeping over time, i.e., surfaces in the space-time domain. They occur at locations where three derived 4D vectors become coplanar. To extract them, we show how to re-formulate the problem using the parallel vectors operator. We apply our method to a number of unsteady flow fields. . unsteady flow visualization, feature extraction, particle motion', 'Objective Vortex Corelines of Finite-sized Objects in Fluid Flows . Vortices are one of the most-frequently studied phenomena in fluid flows. The center of the rotating motion is called the vortex coreline and its successful detection strongly depends on the choice of the reference frame. The optimal frame moves with the center of the vortex, which incidentally makes the observed fluid flow steady and thus standard vortex coreline extractors such as Sujudi-Haimes become applicable. Recently, an objective optimization framework was proposed that determines a near-steady reference frame for tracer particles. In this paper, we extend this technique to the detection of vortex corelines of inertial particles. An inertial particle is a finite-sized object that is carried by a fluid flow. In contrast to the usual tracer particles, they do not move tangentially with the flow, since they are subject to gravity and exhibit mass-dependent inertia. Their particle state is determined by their position and own velocity, which makes the search for the optimal frame a high-dimensional problem. We demonstrate in this paper that the objective detection of an inertial vortex coreline can be reduced in 2D to a critical point search in 2D. For 3D flows, however, the vortex coreline criterion remains a parallel vectors condition in 6D. To detect the vortex corelines we propose a recursive subdivision approach that is tailored to the underlying structure of the 6D vectors. The resulting algorithm is objective, and we demonstrate the vortex coreline extraction in a number of 2D and 3D vector fields. .

Visualizing relational data is crucial for understanding complex connections between entities in social networks, political affiliations, or biological interactions. Well-known representations like node-link diagrams and adjacency matrices offer valuable insights, but their effectiveness relies on the ability to identify patterns in the underlying topological structure. Reordering strategies and layout algorithms play a vital role in the visualization process since the arrangement of nodes, edges, or cells influences the visibility of these patterns. The BioFabric visualization combines elements of node-link diagrams and adjacency matrices, leveraging the strengths of both, the visual clarity of node-link diagrams and the tabular organization of adjacency matrices. A unique characteristic of BioFabric is the possibility to reorder nodes and edges separately. This raises the question of which combination of layout algorithms best reveals certain patterns. In this paper, we discuss patterns and anti-patterns in BioFabric, such as staircases or escalators, relate them to already established patterns, and propose metrics to evaluate their quality. Based on these quality metrics, we compared combinations of well-established reordering techniques applied to BioFabric with a well-known benchmark data set. Our experiments indicate that the edge order has a stronger influence on revealing patterns than the node layout. The results show that the best combination for revealing staircases is a barycentric node layout, together with an edge order based on node indices and length.

Event sequence data is common to a broad range of application domains, from security to health care to scholarly communication. This form of data captures information about the progression of events for an individual entity (e.g., a computer network device; a patient; an author) in the form of a series of time-stamped observations. Moreover, each event is associated with an event type (e.g., a computer login attempt, or a hospital discharge). Analyses of event sequence data have been shown to help reveal important temporal patterns, such as clinical paths resulting in improved outcomes, or an understanding of common career trajectories for scholars. Moreover, recent research has demonstrated a variety of techniques designed to overcome methodological challenges such as large volumes of data and high dimensionality. However, the effective identification and analysis of latent stages of progression, which can allow for variation within different but similarly evolving event sequences, remain a significant challenge with important real-world motivations. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised stage analysis algorithm to identify semantically meaningful progression stages as well as the critical events which help define those stages. The algorithm follows three key steps: (1) event representation estimation, (2) event sequence warping and alignment, and (3) sequence segmentation. We also present a novel visualization system, ET<sup>2</sup>, which interactively illustrates the results of the stage analysis algorithm to help reveal evolution patterns across stages.

For example, event sequence analysis might reveal frequently used care plans for treating a disease, typical publishing patterns of professors, and the patterns of service that result in a well-maintained car. It is challenging, however, to visually explore large numbers of event sequences, or sequences with large numbers of event types. Existing methods focus on extracting explicitly matching patterns of events using statistical analysis to create stages of event progression over time. However, these methods fail to capture latent clusters of similar but not identical evolutions of event sequences. In this paper, we introduce a novel visualization system named EventThread which clusters event sequences into threads based on tensor analysis and visualizes the latent stage categories and evolution patterns by interactively grouping the threads by similarity into time-specific clusters.

Analyzing large textual collections has become increasingly challenging given the size of the data available and the rate that more data is being generated. Topic-based text summarization methods coupled with interactive visualizations have presented promising approaches to address the challenge of analyzing large text corpora. As the text corpora and vocabulary grow larger, more topics need to be generated in order to capture the meaningful latent themes and nuances in the corpora. However, it is difficult for most of current topic-based visualizations to represent large number of topics without being cluttered or illegible. To facilitate the representation and navigation of a large number of topics, we propose a visual analytics system - HierarchicalTopic (HT). HT integrates a computational algorithm, Topic Rose Tree, with an interactive visual interface. The Topic Rose Tree constructs a topic hierarchy based on a list of topics. The interactive visual interface is designed to present the topic content as well as temporal evolution of topics in a hierarchical fashion. User interactions are provided for users to make changes to the topic hierarchy based on their mental model of the topic space. To qualitatively evaluate HT, we present a case study that showcases how HierarchicalTopics aid expert users in making sense of a large number of topics and discovering interesting patterns of topic groups.

Scalable and effective analysis of large text corpora remains a challenging problem as our ability to collect textual data continues to increase at an exponential rate. To help users make sense of large text corpora, we present a novel visual analytics system, Parallel-Topics, which integrates a state-of-the-art probabilistic topic model Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) with interactive visualization. To describe a corpus of documents, ParallelTopics first extracts a set of semantically meaningful topics using LDA. Unlike most traditional clustering techniques in which a document is assigned to a specific cluster, the LDA model accounts for different topical aspects of each individual document. This permits effective full text analysis of larger documents that may contain multiple topics. To highlight this property of the model, ParallelTopics utilizes the parallel coordinate metaphor to present the probabilistic distribution of a document across topics. Such representation allows the users to discover single-topic vs. multi-topic documents and the relative importance of each topic to a document of interest. In addition, since most text corpora are inherently temporal, ParallelTopics also depicts the topic evolution over time. We have applied ParallelTopics to exploring and analyzing several text corpora, including the scientific proposals awarded by the National Science Foundation and the publications in the VAST community over the years. To demonstrate the efficacy of ParallelTopics, we conducted several expert evaluations, the results of which are reported in this paper.', 'EvoRiver: Visual Analysis of Topic Coopetition on Social Media .

We answer these intricate questions by proposing a visual analytics system that facilitates the in-depth analysis of topic coopetition on social media. We model the complex interactions among topics as a combination of carry-over, coopetition recruitment, and coopetition distraction effects. This model provides a close functional approximation of the coopetition process by depicting how different groups of influential users (i.e., “topic leaders”) affect coopetition.

Recent technological innovations have led to an increase in the availability of 3D urban data, such as shadow, noise, solar potential, and earthquake simulations.

However, designing 3D spatiotemporal urban visualizations is challenging, as it requires visual strategies to support analysis of time-varying data referent to the city geometry. Although different visual strategies have been used in 3D urban visual analytics, the question of how effective these visual designs are at supporting spatiotemporal analysis on building surfaces remains open. To investigate this, in this paper we first contribute a series of analytical tasks elicited after interviews with practitioners from three urban domains. We also contribute a quantitative user study comparing the effectiveness of four representative visual designs used to visualize 3D spatiotemporal urban data: spatial juxtaposition, temporal juxtaposition, linked view, and embedded view. Participants performed a series of tasks that required them to identify extreme values on building surfaces over time. Tasks varied in granularity for both space and time dimensions. Our results demonstrate that participants were more accurate using plot-based visualizations (linked view, embedded view) but faster using color-coded visualizations (spatial juxtaposition, temporal juxtaposition). Our results also show that, with increasing task complexity, plot-based visualizations perform better in preserving efficiency (time, accuracy) compared to color-coded visualizations.

Numerous systems have been developed to display large collections of data for urban contexts; however, most have focused on layering of single dimensions of data and manual calculations to understand relationships within the urban environment. Furthermore, these systems often limit the user's perspectives on the data, thereby diminishing the user's spatial understanding of the viewing region. In this paper, we introduce a highly interactive urban visualization tool that provides intuitive understanding of the urban data. Our system utilizes an aggregation method that combines buildings and city blocks into legible clusters, thus providing continuous levels of abstraction while preserving the user's mental model of the city. In conjunction with a 3D view of the urban model, a separate but integrated information visualization view displays multiple disparate dimensions of the urban data, allowing the user to understand the urban environment both spatially and cognitively in one glance. For our evaluation, expert users from various backgrounds viewed a real city model with census data and confirmed that our system allowed them to gain more intuitive and deeper understanding of the urban model from different perspectives and levels of abstraction than existing commercial urban visualization systems. .

We propose TrajGraph, a new visual analytics method, for studying urban mobility patterns by integrating graph modeling and visual analysis with taxi trajectory data. A special graph is created to store and manifest real traffic information recorded by taxi trajectories over city streets. It conveys urban transportation dynamics which can be discovered by applying graph analysis algorithms. To support interactive, multiscale visual analytics, a graph partitioning algorithm is applied to create region-level graphs which have smaller size than the original street-level graph. Graph centralities, including Pagerank and betweenness, are computed to characterize the time-varying importance of different urban regions. The centralities are visualized by three coordinated views including a node-link graph view, a map view and a temporal information view. Users can interactively examine the importance of streets to discover and assess city traffic patterns. We have implemented a fully working prototype of this approach and evaluated it using massive taxi trajectories of Shenzhen, China. TrajGraph's capability in revealing the importance of city streets was evaluated by comparing the calculated centralities with the subjective evaluations from a group of drivers in Shenzhen. Feedback from a domain expert was collected. The effectiveness of the visual interface was evaluated through a formal user study.

Therefore, to get a fully informed decision it is essential to both investigate the vessel morphology and the hemodynamic data. Ongoing research emphasizes the importance of analyzing the wall thickness in risk assessment. Our combination of blood flow visualization and wall thickness representation is a significant improvement for the exploration and analysis of aneurysms.

Accurate estimation of vessel parameters is a prerequisite for automated visualization and analysis of healthy and diseased blood vessels. The objective of this research is to estimate the dimensions of lower extremity arteries, imaged by computed tomography (CT). These parameters are required to get a good quality visualization of healthy as well as diseased arteries using a visualization technique such as curved planar reformation (CPR). The vessel is modeled using an elliptical or cylindrical structure with specific dimensions, orientation and blood vessel mean density. The model separates two homogeneous regions: its inner side represents a region of density for vessels, and its outer side a region for background. Taking into account the point spread function (PSF) of a CT scanner, a function is modeled with a Gaussian kernel, in order to smooth the vessel boundary in the model. A new strategy for vessel parameter estimation is presented. It stems from vessel model and model parameter optimization by a nonlinear optimization procedure, i.e., the Levenberg-Marquardt technique. The method provides center location, diameter and orientation of the vessel as well as blood and background mean density values.

Deep neural networks are now rivaling human accuracy in several pattern recognition problems. Compared to traditional classifiers, where features are handcrafted, neural networks learn increasingly complex features directly from the data. Instead of handcrafting the features, it is now the network architecture that is manually engineered. The network architecture parameters such as the number of layers or the number of filters per layer and their interconnections are essential for good performance. Even though basic design guidelines exist, designing a neural network is an iterative trial-and-error process that takes days or even weeks to perform due to the large datasets used for training. In this paper, we present DeepEyes, a Progressive Visual Analytics system that supports the design of neural networks during training. We present novel visualizations, supporting the identification of layers that learned a stable set of patterns and, therefore, are of interest for a detailed analysis. The system facilitates the identification of problems, such as superfluous filters or layers, and information that is not being captured by the network.

We have experimented with several information visualization designs aiming to open the black box to possibly uncover underlying dependencies between the input data and the output data of a neural network.

Existing visual analytics tools for neural networks have been demonstrated to be effective in providing useful hints for debugging certain network architectures.

Treemaps are space-filling visualizations that make efficient use of limited display space to depict large amounts of hierarchical data. Creating perceptually effective treemaps requires carefully managing a number of design parameters including the aspect ratio and luminance of rectangles. Moreover, treemaps encode values using area, which has been found to be less accurate than judgments of other visual encodings, such as length. We conduct a series of controlled experiments aimed at producing a set of design guidelines for creating effective rectangular treemaps. We find no evidence that luminance affects area judgments, but observe that aspect ratio does have an effect. Specifically, we find that the accuracy of area comparisons suffers when the compared rectangles have extreme aspect ratios or when both are squares. Contrary to common assumptions, the optimal distribution of rectangle aspect ratios within a treemap should include non-squares, but should avoid extremes. We then compare treemaps with hierarchical bar chart displays to identify the data densities at which length-encoded bar charts become less effective than area-encoded treemaps. We report the transition points at which treemaps exhibit judgment accuracy on par with bar charts for both leaf and non-leaf tree nodes. We also find that even at relatively low data densities treemaps result in faster comparisons than bar charts.

While the treemap is a popular method for visualizing hierarchical data, it is often difficult for users to track layout and attribute changes when the data evolve over time. When viewing the treemaps side by side or back and forth, there exist several problems that can prevent viewers from performing effective comparisons. Those problems include abrupt layout changes, a lack of prominent visual patterns to represent layouts, and a lack of direct contrast to highlight differences. In this paper, we present strategies to visualize changes of hierarchical data using treemaps. A new treemap layout algorithm is presented to reduce abrupt layout changes and produce consistent visual patterns. Techniques are proposed to effectively visualize the difference and contrast between two treemap snapshots in terms of the map items' colors, sizes, and positions.

In particular, by taking advantage of physically reactive 3D shadow-space controllers, we can transform the task of interacting with 4D objects to a new level of physical reality. We begin with a teaching tool that uses 2D knot diagrams to manipulate the geometry of 3D mathematical knots via their projections; our unique 2D haptic interface allows the user to become familiar with sketching, editing, exploration, and manipulation of 3D knots rendered as projected images on a 2D shadow space.

Haptic feedback provides an essential sensory stimulus crucial for interaction and analyzing three-dimensional spatio-temporal phenomena on surface visualizations. Given its ability to provide enhanced spatial perception and scene maneuverability, virtual reality (VR) catalyzes haptic interactions on surface visualizations. Various interaction modes, encompassing both mid-air and on-surface interactions—with or without the application of assisting force stimuli—have been explored using haptic force feedback devices. In this paper, we evaluate the use of on-surface and assisted on-surface haptic modes of interaction compared to a no-haptic interaction mode. A force-based haptic stylus is used for all three modalities; the on-surface mode uses collision based forces, whereas the assisted on-surface mode is accompanied by an additional snapping force. We conducted a within-subjects user study involving fundamental interaction tasks performed on surface visualizations. Keeping a consistent visual design across all three modes, our study incorporates tasks that require the localization of the highest, lowest, and random points on surfaces; and tasks that focus on brushing curves on surfaces with varying complexity and occlusion levels. Our findings show that participants took almost the same time to brush curves using all the interaction modes. They could draw smoother curves using the on-surface interaction modes compared to the no-haptic mode. However, the assisted on-surface mode provided better accuracy than the on-surface mode. The on-surface mode was slower in point localization, but the accuracy depended on the visual cues and occlusions associated with the tasks.

The number of simulations used for forecasting is growing with the advent of increase in computing power. Hence, there is a need for providing better visual insights of uncertainty with growing number of ensemble members. We propose a geo visual analytical framework that uses visual analytics approach to resolve visual scalability of these ensemble members. Our approach naturally fits with the workflow of an analyst analyzing ensemble spatial uncertainty.

From the simulation setup to the analysis of results, working with weather simulations involves several manual and error-prone steps. The complexity of the problem increases exponentially when the experts must deal with ensembles of simulations, a frequent task in their daily duties.

Forecast meteorologists are interested in understanding the uncertainties associated with numerical weather prediction; specifically variability between the ensemble members. Currently, visualization of ensemble members is mostly accomplished through spaghetti plots of a single midtroposphere pressure surface height contour.

Bootstrapping was employed to overcome the dependence on normality in the uncertainty metrics. A coordinated view of ribbon and glyph-based uncertainty visualization, spaghetti plots, iso-pressure colormaps, and data transect plots was provided to two meteorologists for expert evaluation. They found it useful in assessing uncertainty in the data, especially in finding outliers in the ensemble run and therefore avoiding the WRF parameterizations that lead to these outliers.

Interactions between atoms have a major influence on the chemical properties of molecular systems.

The understanding of these types of interactions is necessary for the interpretation of many biological processes and chemical design tasks. While traditionally the electron density is analyzed to interpret the quantum chemistry of a molecular system, noncovalent interactions are characterized by low electron densities and only slight variations of them - challenging their extraction and characterization. Recently, the signed electron density and the reduced gradient, two scalar fields derived from the electron density, have drawn much attention in quantum chemistry since they enable a qualitative visualization of these interactions even in complex molecular systems and experimental measurements. In this work, we present the first combinatorial algorithm for the automated extraction and characterization of covalent and noncovalent interactions in molecular systems.

The evolution view looks at different versions in a project lifetime of a number of selected source files. The views share one code model, which combines hierarchical syntax based and line based information from multiple source files versions. We render this code model using a visual model that extends the pixel-filling, space partitioning properties of shaded cushion treemaps with novel techniques. We discuss how our views allow users to interactively answer complex questions on various code elements by simple mouse clicks. We validate the efficiency and effectiveness of our toolset by an informal user study on the source code of VTK, a large, industry-size C++ code base . source code visualization, multiple views, treemaps, pixel-filling displays, source code analysis', 'Visual Analysis of Inter-Process Communication for Large-Scale Parallel Computing . In serial computation, program profiling is often helpful for optimization of key sections of code. When moving to parallel computation, not only does the code execution need to be considered but also communication between the different processes which can induce delays that are detrimental to performance. As the number of processes increases, so does the impact of the communication delays on performance. For large-scale parallel applications, it is critical to understand how the communication impacts performance in order to make the code more efficient. There are several tools available for visualizing program execution and communications on parallel systems. These tools generally provide either views which statistically summarize the entire program execution or process-centric views. However, process-centric visualizations do not scale well as the number of processes gets very large. In particular, the most common representation of parallel processes is a Gantt chart with a row for each process. As the number of processes increases, these charts can become difficult to work with and can even exceed screen resolution. We propose a new visualization approach that affords more scalability and then demonstrate it on systems running with up to 16,384 processes. . Information Visualization, MPI Profiling, Scalability', 'CcNav: Understanding Compiler Optimizations in Binary Code . Program developers spend significant time on optimizing and tuning programs. During this iterative process, they apply optimizations, analyze the resulting code, and modify the compilation until they are satisfied. Understanding what the compiler did with the code is crucial to this process but is very time-consuming and labor-intensive. Users need to navigate through thousands of lines of binary code and correlate it to source code concepts to understand the results of the compilation and to identify optimizations. We present a design study in collaboration with program developers and performance analysts. Our collaborators work with various artifacts related to the program such as binary code, source code, control flow graphs, and call graphs. Through interviews, feedback, and pair-analytics sessions, we analyzed their tasks and workflow. Based on this task analysis and through a human-centric design process, we designed a visual analytics system Compilation Navigator (CcNav) to aid exploration of the effects of compiler optimizations on the program. CcNav provides a streamlined workflow and a unified context that integrates disparate artifacts. CcNav supports consistent interactions across all the artifacts making it easy to correlate binary code with source code concepts. CcNav enables users to navigate and filter large binary code to identify and summarize optimizations such as inlining, vectorization, loop unrolling, and code hoisting. We evaluate CcNav through guided sessions and semi-structured interviews.

To interpret the meanings of colors in visualizations of categorical information, people must determine how distinct colors correspond to different concepts. This process is easier when assignments between colors and concepts in visualizations match people's expectations, making color palettes semantically interpretable. Efforts have been underway to optimize color palette design for semantic interpretablity, but this requires having good estimates of human color-concept associations. Obtaining these data from humans is costly, which motivates the need for automated methods. We developed and evaluated a new method for automatically estimating color-concept associations in a way that strongly correlates with human ratings. Building on prior studies using Google Images, our approach operates directly on Google Image search results without the need for humans in the loop. Specifically, we evaluated several methods for extracting raw pixel content of the images in order to best estimate color-concept associations obtained from human ratings. The most effective method extracted colors using a combination of cylindrical sectors and color categories in color space. We demonstrate that our approach can accurately estimate average human color-concept associations for different fruits using only a small set of images. The approach also generalizes moderately well to more complicated recycling-related concepts of objects that can appear in any color. . Visual Reasoning,Visual Communication,Visual Encoding,Color Perception,Color Cognition,Color Categories"", ""Context Matters: A Theory of Semantic Discriminability for Perceptual Encoding Systems . People's associations between colors and concepts influence their ability to interpret the meanings of colors in information visualizations. Previous work has suggested such effects are limited to concepts that have strong, specific associations with colors. However, although a concept may not be strongly associated with any colors, its mapping can be disambiguated in the context of other concepts in an encoding system. We articulate this view in semantic discriminability theory, a general framework for understanding conditions determining when people can infer meaning from perceptual features. Semantic discriminability is the degree to which observers can infer a unique mapping between visual features and concepts. Semantic discriminability theory posits that the capacity for semantic discriminability for a set of concepts is constrained by the difference between the feature-concept association distributions across the concepts in the set. We define formal properties of this theory and test its implications in two experiments. The results show that the capacity to produce semantically discriminable colors for sets of concepts was indeed constrained by the statistical distance between color-concept association distributions (Experiment 1). Moreover, people could interpret meanings of colors in bar graphs insofar as the colors were semantically discriminable, even for concepts previously considered “non-colorable” (Experiment 2). The results suggest that colors are more robust for visual communication than previously thought. . Visual Reasoning,Information Visualization,Visual Communication,Visual Encoding,Color Cognition"", ""Unifying Effects of Direct and Relational Associations for Visual Communication . People have expectations about how colors map to concepts in visualizations, and they are better at interpreting visualizations that match their expectations. Traditionally, studies on these expectations (inferred mappings) distinguished distinct factors relevant for visualizations of categorical vs. continuous information. Studies on categorical information focused on direct associations (e.g., mangos are associated with yellows) whereas studies on continuous information focused on relational associations (e.g., darker colors map to larger quantities; dark-is-more bias). We unite these two areas within a single framework of assignment inference. Assignment inference is the process by which people infer mappings between perceptual features and concepts represented in encoding systems. Observers infer globally optimal assignments by maximizing the “merit,” or “goodness,” of each possible assignment. Previous work on assignment inference focused on visualizations of categorical information. We extend this approach to visualizations of continuous data by (a) broadening the notion of merit to include relational associations and (b) developing a method for combining multiple (sometimes conflicting) sources of merit to predict people's inferred mappings. We developed and tested our model on data from experiments in which participants interpreted colormap data visualizations, representing fictitious data about environmental concepts (sunshine, shade, wild fire, ocean water, glacial ice). We found both direct and relational associations contribute independently to inferred mappings. These results can be used to optimize visualization design to facilitate visual communication. .

Topological methods give concise and expressive visual representations of flow fields. The present work suggests a comparable method for the visualization of human brain diffusion MRI data. We explore existing techniques for the topological analysis of generic tensor fields, but find them inappropriate for diffusion MRI data. Thus, we propose a novel approach that considers the asymptotic behavior of a probabilistic fiber tracking method and define analogs of the basic concepts of flow topology, like critical points, basins, and faces, with interpretations in terms of brain anatomy. The resulting features are fuzzy, reflecting the uncertainty inherent in any connectivity estimate from diffusion imaging. We describe an algorithm to extract the new type of features, demonstrate its robustness under noise, and present results for two regions in a diffusion MRI dataset to illustrate that the method allows a meaningful visual analysis of probabilistic fiber tracking results. . Diffusion tensor, probabilistic fiber tracking, tensor topology, uncertainty visualization', 'Fast and reproducible fiber bundle selection in DTI visualization . Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is an MRI-based technique for quantifying water diffusion in living tissue. In the white matter of the brain, water diffuses more rapidly along the neuronal axons than in the perpendicular direction. By exploiting this phenomenon, DTI can be used to determine trajectories of fiber bundles, or neuronal connections between regions, in the brain. The resulting bundles can be visualized. However, the resulting visualizations can be complex and difficult to interpret. An effective approach is to pre-determine trajectories from a large number of positions throughout the white matter (full brain fiber tracking) and to offer facilities to aid the user in selecting fiber bundles of interest. Two factors are crucial for the use and acceptance of this technique in clinical studies: firstly, the selection of the bundles by brain experts should be interactive, supported by real-time visualization of the trajectories registered with anatomical MRI scans. Secondly, the fiber selections should be reproducible, so that different experts will achieve the same results. In this paper we present a practical technique for the interactive selection of fiber-bundles using multiple convex objects that is an order of magnitude faster than similar techniques published earlier. We also present the results of a clinical study with ten subjects that show that our selection approach is highly reproducible for fractional anisotropy (FA) calculated over the selected fiber bundles. . diffusion tensor imaging, tractography, white matter', 'Glyph-Based Comparative Visualization for Diffusion Tensor Fields . Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) is a magnetic resonance imaging modality that enables the in-vivo reconstruction and visualization of fibrous structures. To inspect the local and individual diffusion tensors, glyph-based visualizations are commonly used since they are able to effectively convey full aspects of the diffusion tensor. For several applications it is necessary to compare tensor fields, e.g., to study the effects of acquisition parameters, or to investigate the influence of pathologies on white matter structures. This comparison is commonly done by extracting scalar information out of the tensor fields and then comparing these scalar fields, which leads to a loss of information. If the glyph representation is kept, simple juxtaposition or superposition can be used. However, neither facilitates the identification and interpretation of the differences between the tensor fields. Inspired by the checkerboard style visualization and the superquadric tensor glyph, we design a new glyph to locally visualize differences between two diffusion tensors by combining juxtaposition and explicit encoding. Because tensor scale, anisotropy type, and orientation are related to anatomical information relevant for DTI applications, we focus on visualizing tensor differences in these three aspects. As demonstrated in a user study, our new glyph design allows users to efficiently and effectively identify the tensor differences. We also apply our new glyphs to investigate the differences between DTI datasets of the human brain in two different contexts using different b-values, and to compare datasets from a healthy and HIV-infected subject. .

The paper presents a framework for multiresolution compression and geometric reconstruction of arbitrarily dimensioned data designed for distributed applications. Although being restricted to uniform sampled data, the versatile approach enables the handling of a large variety of real world elements. Examples include nonparametric, parametric and implicit lines, surfaces or volumes, all of which are common to large scale data sets. The framework is based on two fundamental steps: compression is carried out by a remote server and generates a bit-stream transmitted over the underlying network. Geometric reconstruction is performed by the local client and renders a piecewise linear approximation of the data. More precisely, the compression scheme consists of a newly developed pipeline starting from an initial B-spline wavelet precoding. The fundamental properties of wavelets allow progressive transmission and interactive control of the compression gain by means of global and local oracles. In particular the authors discuss the problem of oracles in semiorthogonal settings and propose sophisticated oracles to remove unimportant coefficients. In addition, geometric constraints such as boundary lines can be compressed in a lossless manner and are incorporated into the resulting bit-stream. The reconstruction pipeline performs a piecewise adaptive linear approximation of data using a fast and easy to use point removal strategy which works with any subsequent triangulation technique. . wavelets, isosurfaces, volumes, triangulation, tetrahedralization, meshing, oracles', 'Bicubic subdivision-surface wavelets for large-scale isosurface representation and visualization . We introduce a new subdivision-surface wavelet transform for arbitrary two-manifolds with boundary that is the first to use simple lifting-style filtering operations with bicubic precision. We also describe a conversion process for re-mapping large-scale isosurfaces to have subdivision connectivity and fair parameterizations so that the new wavelet transform can be used for compression and visualization. The main idea enabling our wavelet transform is the circular symmetrization of the filters in irregular neighborhoods, which replaces the traditional separation of filters into two 1D passes. Our wavelet transform uses polygonal base meshes to represent surface topology, from which a Catmull-Clark-style subdivision hierarchy is generated. The details between these levels of resolution are quickly computed and compactly stored as wavelet coefficients. The isosurface conversion process begins with a contour triangulation computed using conventional techniques, which we subsequently simplify with a variant edge-collapse procedure, followed by an edge-removal process. This provides a coarse initial base mesh, which is subsequently refined, relaxed and attracted in phases to converge to the contour. The conversion is designed to produce smooth, untangled and minimally-skewed parameterizations which improves the subsequent compression after applying the transform. We have demonstrated our conversion and transform for an isosurface obtained from a high-resolution turbulent-mixing hydrodynamics simulation, showing the potential for compression and level-of-detail visualization.', 'Progressive transmission of scientific data using biorthogonal wavelet transform . An important issue in scientific visualization systems is the management of data sets. Most data sets in scientific visualization, whether created by measurement or simulation, are usually voluminous. The goal of data management is to reduce the storage space and the access time of these data sets to speed up the visualization process. A new progressive transmission scheme using spline biorthogonal wavelet bases is proposed in this paper. By exploiting the properties of this set of wavelet bases, a fast algorithm involving only additions and subtractions is developed. Due to the multiresolutional nature of the wavelet transform, this scheme is compatible with hierarchical-structured rendering algorithms. The formula for reconstructing the functional values in a continuous volume space is given in a simple polynomial form. Lossless compression is possible, even when using floating-point numbers. This algorithm has been applied to data from a global ocean model. The lossless compression ratio is about 1.5:1. With a compression ratio of 50:1, the reconstructed data is still of good quality. Several other wavelet bases are compared with the spline biorthogonal wavelet bases.

Analysis of degenerate tensors is a fundamental step in finding the topological structures and separatrices in tensor fields. Previous work in this area have been limited to analyzing symmetric second order tensor fields. In this paper, we extend the topological analysis to 2D general (asymmetric) second order tensor fields. We show that it is not sufficient to define degeneracies based on eigenvalues alone, but one must also include the eigenvectors in the analysis. We also study the behavior of these eigenvectors as they cross from one topological region into another. . critical points, general tensors, symmetric tensors,degenerate tensors, tensor topology, topological lines, hyperstream-lines', 'Global Topology of 3D Symmetric Tensor Fields . There have been recent advances in the analysis and visualization of 3D symmetric tensor fields, with a focus on the robust extraction of tensor field topology. However, topological features such as degenerate curves and neutral surfaces do not live in isolation. Instead, they intriguingly interact with each other. In this paper, we introduce the notion of topological graph for 3D symmetric tensor fields to facilitate global topological analysis of such fields. The nodes of the graph include degenerate curves and regions bounded by neutral surfaces in the domain. The edges in the graph denote the adjacency information between the regions and degenerate curves. In addition, we observe that a degenerate curve can be a loop and even a knot and that two degenerate curves (whether in the same region or not) can form a link. We provide a definition and theoretical analysis of individual degenerate curves in order to help understand why knots and links may occur. Moreover, we differentiate between wedges and trisectors, thus making the analysis more detailed about degenerate curves. We incorporate this information into the topological graph. Such a graph can not only reveal the global structure in a 3D symmetric tensor field but also allow two symmetric tensor fields to be compared. We demonstrate our approach by applying it to solid mechanics and material science data sets. .

Existing research in tensor field visualization focuses on 2D asymmetric tensor fields and 3D symmetric tensor fields. In this paper, we address the analysis and visualization of 3D asymmetric tensor fields. We introduce six topological surfaces and one topological curve, which lead to an eigenvalue space based on the tensor mode that we define. In addition, we identify several non-topological feature surfaces that are nonetheless physically important. Included in our analysis are the realizations that triple degenerate tensors are structurally stable and form curves, unlike the case for 3D symmetric tensors fields. Furthermore, there are two different ways of measuring the relative strengths of rotation and angular deformation in the tensor fields, unlike the case for 2D asymmetric tensor fields. We extract these feature surfaces using the A-patches algorithm. However, since three of our feature surfaces are quadratic, we develop a method to extract quadratic surfaces at any given accuracy.

In the last decades cosmological N-body dark matter simulations have enabled ab initio studies of the formation of structure in the Universe. Gravity amplified small density fluctuations generated shortly after the Big Bang, leading to the formation of galaxies in the cosmic web. These calculations have led to a growing demand for methods to analyze time-dependent particle based simulations. Rendering methods for such N-body simulation data usually employ some kind of splatting approach via point based rendering primitives and approximate the spatial distributions of physical quantities using kernel interpolation techniques, common in SPH (Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics)-codes. This paper proposes three GPU-assisted rendering approaches, based on a new, more accurate method to compute the physical densities of dark matter simulation data. It uses full phase-space information to generate a tetrahedral tessellation of the computational domain, with mesh vertices defined by the simulation's dark matter particle positions. Over time the mesh is deformed by gravitational forces, causing the tetrahedral cells to warp and overlap. The new methods are well suited to visualize the cosmic web. In particular they preserve caustics, regions of high density that emerge, when several streams of dark matter particles share the same location in space, indicating the formation of structures like sheets, filaments and halos. We demonstrate the superior image quality of the new approaches in a comparison with three standard rendering techniques for N-body simulation data. .

Atmospheric effects are crucial in data analysis and to provide contextual information for planetary data.

Event sequence mining is often used to summarize patterns from hundreds of sequences but faces special challenges when handling racket sports data. In racket sports (e.g., tennis and badminton), a player hitting the ball is considered a multivariate event consisting of multiple attributes (e.g., hit technique and ball position). A rally (i.e., a series of consecutive hits beginning with one player serving the ball and ending with one player winning a point) thereby can be viewed as a multivariate event sequence. Mining frequent patterns and depicting how patterns change over time is instructive and meaningful to players who want to learn more short-term competitive strategies (i.e., tactics) that encompass multiple hits. However, players in racket sports usually change their tactics rapidly according to the opponent's reaction, resulting in ever-changing tactic progression. In this work, we introduce a tailored visualization system built on a novel multivariate sequence pattern mining algorithm to facilitate explorative identification and analysis of various tactics and tactic progression. The algorithm can mine multiple non-overlapping multivariate patterns from hundreds of sequences effectively.

Visualization System,Spatial Video,Autonomous Driving,Vision-based Deep Learning Models', 'Visual Evaluation for Autonomous Driving . Autonomous driving technologies often use state-of-the-art artificial intelligence algorithms to understand the relationship between the vehicle and the external environment, to predict the changes of the environment, and then to plan and control the behaviors of the vehicle accordingly. The complexity of such technologies makes it challenging to evaluate the performance of autonomous driving systems and to find ways to improve them. The current approaches to evaluating such autonomous driving systems largely use a single score to indicate the overall performance of a system, but domain experts have difficulties in understanding how individual components or algorithms in an autonomous driving system may contribute to the score. To address this problem, we collaborate with domain experts on autonomous driving algorithms, and propose a visual evaluation method for autonomous driving. Our method considers the data generated in all components during the whole process of autonomous driving, including perception results, planning routes, prediction of obstacles, various controlling parameters, and evaluation of comfort. We develop a visual analytics workflow to integrate an evaluation mathematical model with adjustable parameters, support the evaluation of the system from the level of the overall performance to the level of detailed measures of individual components, and to show both evaluation scores and their contributing factors. Our implemented visual analytics system provides an overview evaluation score at the beginning and shows the animation of the dynamic change of the scores at each period. Experts can interactively explore the specific component at different time periods and identify related factors. With our method, domain experts not only learn about the performance of an autonomous driving system, but also identify and access the problematic parts of each component. Our visual evaluation system can be applied to the autonomous driving simulation system and used for various evaluation cases. The results of using our system in some simulation cases and the feedback from involved domain experts confirm the usefulness and efficiency of our method in helping people gain in-depth insight into autonomous driving systems. .

Visual data stories can effectively convey insights from data, yet their creation often necessitates intricate data exploration, insight discovery, narrative organization, and customization to meet the communication objectives of the storyteller. Existing automated data storytelling techniques, however, tend to overlook the importance of user customization during the data story authoring process, limiting the system's ability to create tailored narratives that reflect the user's intentions. We present a novel data story generation workflow that leverages adaptive machine-guided elicitation of user feedback to customize the story. Our approach employs an adaptive plug-in module for existing story generation systems, which incorporates user feedback through interactive questioning based on the conversation history and dataset. This adaptability refines the system's understanding of the user's intentions, ensuring the final narrative aligns with their goals. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach through the implementation of an interactive prototype: Socrates. Through a quantitative user study with 18 participants that compares our method to a state-of-the-art data story generation algorithm, we show that Socrates produces more relevant stories with a larger overlap of insights compared to human-generated stories. We also demonstrate the usability of Socrates via interviews with three data analysts and highlight areas of future work. . Narrative visualization,visual storytelling,conversational agent"", ""A Design Space for Applying the Freytag's Pyramid Structure to Data Stories . Data stories integrate compelling visual content to communicate data insights in the form of narratives. The narrative structure of a data story serves as the backbone that determines its expressiveness, and it can largely influence how audiences perceive the insights. Freytag's Pyramid is a classic narrative structure that has been widely used in film and literature. While there are continuous recommendations and discussions about applying Freytag's Pyramid to data stories, little systematic and practical guidance is available on how to use Freytag's Pyramid for creating structured data stories. To bridge this gap, we examined how existing practices apply Freytag's Pyramid by analyzing stories extracted from 103 data videos. Based on our findings, we proposed a design space of narrative patterns, data flows, and visual communications to provide practical guidance on achieving narrative intents, organizing data facts, and selecting visual design techniques through story creation. We evaluated the proposed design space through a workshop with 25 participants. Results show that our design space provides a clear framework for rapid storyboarding of data stories with Freytag's Pyramid. . Freytag's Pyramid,Narrative Structure,Narrative Visualization,Data Storytelling,Data Video"", 'Narrative Visualization: Telling Stories with Data . Data visualization is regularly promoted for its ability to reveal stories within data, yet these “data stories” differ in important ways from traditional forms of storytelling. Storytellers, especially online journalists, have increasingly been integrating visualizations into their narratives, in some cases allowing the visualization to function in place of a written story. In this paper, we systematically review the design space of this emerging class of visualizations. Drawing on case studies from news media to visualization research, we identify distinct genres of narrative visualization. We characterize these design differences, together with interactivity and messaging, in terms of the balance between the narrative flow intended by the author (imposed by graphical elements and the interface) and story discovery on the part of the reader (often through interactive exploration). Our framework suggests design strategies for narrative visualization, including promising under-explored approaches to journalistic storytelling and educational media. .

In this paper, we present a volume roaming system dedicated to oil and gas exploration. Our system combines probe-based volume rendering with data processing and computing. The daily oil production and the estimation of the world proven-reserves directly affect the barrel price and have a strong impact on the economy. Among others, production and correct estimation are linked to the accuracy of the sub-surface model used for predicting oil reservoirs shape and size. Geoscientists build this model from the interpretation of seismic data, i.e. 3D images of the subsurface obtained from geophysical surveys. Our system couples visualization and data processing for the interpretation of seismic data. It is based on volume roaming along with efficient volume paging to manipulate the multi-gigabyte data sets commonly acquired during seismic surveys. Our volume rendering lenses implement high quality pre-integrated volume rendering with accurate lighting. They use a generic multi-modal volume rendering system that blends several volumes in the spirit of the ""stencil"" paradigm used in 2D painting programs. In addition, our system can interactively display non-polygonal isosurfaces painted with an attribute. Beside the visualization algorithms, automatic extraction of local features of the subsurface model also take full advantage of the volume paging. .

Over the past few years, large human populations around the world have been affected by an increase in significant seismic activities. For both conducting basic scientific research and for setting critical government policies, it is crucial to be able to explore and understand seismic and geographical information obtained through all scientific instruments. In this work, we present a visual analytics system that enables explorative visualization of seismic data together with satellite-based observational data, and introduce a suite of visual analytical tools. Seismic and satellite data are integrated temporally and spatially. Users can select temporal ;and spatial ranges to zoom in on specific seismic events, as well as to inspect changes both during and after the events. Tools for designing high dimensional transfer functions have been developed to enable efficient and intuitive comprehension of the multi-modal data. Spread-sheet style comparisons are used for data drill-down as well as presentation. Comparisons between distinct seismic events are also provided for characterizing event-wise differences. Our system has been designed for scalability in terms of data size, complexity (i.e. number of modalities), and varying form factors of display environments. .

We present a toolbox for quickly interpreting and illustrating 2D slices of seismic volumetric reflection data. Searching for oil and gas involves creating a structural overview of seismic reflection data to identify hydrocarbon reservoirs. We improve the search of seismic structures by precalculating the horizon structures of the seismic data prior to interpretation. We improve the annotation of seismic structures by applying novel illustrative rendering algorithms tailored to seismic data, such as deformed texturing and line and texture transfer functions. The illustrative rendering results in multi-attribute and scale invariant visualizations where features are represented clearly in both highly zoomed in and zoomed out views. Thumbnail views in combination with interactive appearance control allows for a quick overview of the data before detailed interpretation takes place.

Centralized techniques have been used until now when automatically calibrating (both geometrically and photometrically) large high-resolution displays created by tiling multiple projectors in a 2D array. A centralized server managed all the projectors and also the camera(s) used to calibrate the display. In this paper, we propose an asynchronous distributed calibration methodology via a display unit called the plug-and-play projector (PPP). The PPP consists of a projector, camera, computation and communication unit, thus creating a self-sufficient module that enables an asynchronous distributed architecture for multi-projector displays. We present a single-program-multiple-data (SPMD) calibration algorithm that runs on each PPP and achieves a truly scalable and reconfigurable display without any input from the user. It instruments novel capabilities like adding/removing PPPs from the display dynamically, detecting faults, and reshaping the display to a reasonable rectangular shape to react to the addition/removal/faults. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to realize a completely asynchronous and distributed calibration architecture and methodology for multi-projector displays .

Multi-projector displays today are automatically registered, both geometrically and photometrically, using cameras. Existing registration techniques assume pre-calibrated projectors and cameras that are devoid of imperfections such as lens distortion. In practice, however, these devices are usually imperfect and uncalibrated. Registration of each of these devices is often more challenging than the multi-projector display registration itself. To make tiled projection-based displays accessible to a layman user we should allow the use of uncalibrated inexpensive devices that are prone to imperfections. In this paper, we make two important advances in this direction. First, we present a new geometric registration technique that can achieve geometric alignment in the presence of severe projector lens distortion using a relatively inexpensive low-resolution camera. This is achieved via a closed-form model that relates the projectors to cameras, in planar multi-projector displays, using rational Bezier patches. This enables us to geometrically calibrate a 3000 times 2500 resolution planar multi-projector display made of 3 times 3 array of nine severely distorted projectors using a low resolution (640 times 480) VGA camera. Second, we present a photometric self-calibration technique for a projector-camera pair. This allows us to photometrically calibrate the same display made of nine projectors using a photometrically uncalibrated camera. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that allows geometrically imperfect projectors and photometrically uncalibrated cameras in calibrating multi-projector displays. . Geometric calibration, photometric calibration, tiled displays', 'Scalable alignment of large-format multi-projector displays using camera homography trees . This paper presents a vision-based geometric alignment system for aligning the projectors in an arbitrarily large display wall. Existing algorithms typically rely on a single camera view and degrade in accuracy as the display resolution exceeds the camera resolution by several orders of magnitude. Naive approaches to integrating multiple zoomed camera views fail since small errors in aligning adjacent views propagate quickly over the display surface to create glaring discontinuities. Our algorithm builds and refines a camera homography tree to automatically register any number of uncalibrated camera images; the resulting system is both faster and significantly more accurate than competing approaches, reliably achieving alignment errors of 0.55 pixels on a 24-projector display in under 9 minutes. Detailed experiments compare our system to two recent display wall alignment algorithms, both on our 18 Megapixel display wall and in simulation. These results indicate that our approach achieves sub-pixel accuracy even on displays with hundreds of projectors. . large-format tiled projection display, display wall, camera-projector systems, camera-based registration and calibration, automatic alignment, scalability, simulation, evaluation']",projector • display systems • immersive display • tiled display,Multi-Projector Displays,Immersive / Tiled Displays & Multi-Projector Calibration
